# Dotfiles
    What are dotfiles?
    Basically they are text files that contain configuration for various softwares.
    Usually they are hidden due to the dot preceding the file name (therefore dotfiles).
    UNIX-like systems treat such files as hidden files.

## Some of the scripts are not made by me, like volume control however as they are open source you can use them however you want. That goes for my scripts too.

These dotfiles are specifically customised for bspwm however I tried to keep them as universal as possible.
